# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run Back-End

In the project directory, move in "back-end" folder and run:

### `yarn dev`

The data is now deployed on port 3000

## Run Front-End

Open a new command terminal. In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Since port 3000 is already running on port 3000 by the back-end, the terminal asks you "Would you like to run the app on another port instead?"

So press "Y"

Runs the app in the development mode.\
